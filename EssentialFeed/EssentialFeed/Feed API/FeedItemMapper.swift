    // Separate module that represents the API version of the FeedItem 👌🤩

    // so instead of ImageURL in the generic module (FeedItem) which is right from the naming point of view, as ImageURL describes exactly what is that
    // The API replied with image only 🥲
    // So no problem, will keep the right naming in the generic domain FeedItem, and make a private type in the middle to do that ugly naming for us, with out polluting the generic type 😼

    // we created this private struct just for one reason, to mirror the response from the API
    // so we have a Root response which contains a key called `items`
    // each item should be `RemoteFeedItem` 👍
