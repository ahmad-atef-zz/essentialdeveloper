# Assert for Specific Error:

---

- `Loader:` is the responsibility that should ***`load`*** the data from a **`URL`**
- `Client:` is the responsibility that should ***`request`*** the data from a **`URL`**
- `Loader` has a `Client` + `URL` as a destination point.
- Client should have dependency thorough a function, so when you call the request method on client, you should pass the URL, which is configured from the loader.
- Client can fail, so it should return completion handler with Result <Item, Error>
- The error type that can return from Client should be Generic.
- Loader also should have a completion handler with Specific Domain Error type.


### Narrative #2

```
As an offline customer
I want the app to show the latest saved version of my image feed
So I can always enjoy images of my friends
```

#### Scenarios (Acceptance criteria)

```
Given the customer doesn't have connectivity
  And there’s a cached version of the feed
  And the cache is less than seven days old
 When the customer requests to see the feed
 Then the app should display the latest feed saved

Given the customer doesn't have connectivity
  And there’s a cached version of the feed
  And the cache is seven days old or more
 When the customer requests to see the feed
 Then the app should display an error message

Given the customer doesn't have connectivity
  And the cache is empty
 When the customer requests to see the feed
 Then the app should display an error message
```

## Use Cases

### Load Feed From Remote Use Case

#### Data:
- URL

#### Primary course (happy path):
1. Execute "Load Image Feed" command with above data.
2. System downloads data from the URL.
3. System validates downloaded data.
4. System creates image feed from valid data.
5. System delivers image feed.

#### Invalid data – error course (sad path):
1. System delivers invalid data error.

#### No connectivity – error course (sad path):
1. System delivers connectivity error.

3. System validates downloaded data.
4. System delivers image data.

#### Cancel course:
1. System does not deliver image data nor error.

#### Invalid data – error course (sad path):
1. System delivers invalid data error.

#### No connectivity – error course (sad path):

### Load Feed From Cache Use Case

#### Primary course:
1. Execute "Load Image Feed" command with above data.
2. System retrieves feed data from cache.
3. System validates cache is less than seven days old.
4. System creates image feed from cached data.
5. System delivers image feed.

#### Retrieval error course (sad path):
1. System delivers error.

#### Expired cache course (sad path): 
1. System delivers no feed images.

#### Empty cache course (sad path): 
1. System delivers no feed images.
